## Installation

Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Python-DataBridge.git
cd Python-DataBridge


Create a virtual environment:

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate


Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Configuration
