Python can interact with MySQL databases using a database driver (also called a connector or adapter).
This driver implements the Python Database API Specification (PEP 249), allowing you to execute SQL queries, fetch results, and manage connections in a standardized way.

MySQL itself does not come built-in with Python support, so you need to install a third-party module/driver.

Popular MySQL Drivers for Python
Here are the most common ones (as of 2026):

    1. MySQL Connector/Python (official from Oracle/MySQL)
        • Pure Python implementation (no external libraries needed).
        • Optionally uses a C extension for better performance.
        • Fully supported by Oracle, compliant with PEP 249.
        • Best for beginners, official features, and cross-platform ease.

    2. mysqlclient (fork of MySQLdb)
        • Uses the MySQL C client library — fastest performance.
        • Requires compilation or system libraries.
        • Popular in production for speed.

    3. PyMySQL
        • Pure Python (easy install, no compilation).
        • Drop-in replacement for MySQLdb in many cases.
        • Good for async/gevent environments.

For a first introduction, the official MySQL Connector/Python is recommended because it's straightforward, well-documented, and maintained by MySQL's creators.

Installing the Module/Driver
Use pip to install the official connector:

"pip install mysql-connector-python"

This installs the latest version
