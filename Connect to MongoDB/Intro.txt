MongoDB is a popular NoSQL database that stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents (called BSON internally). Unlike traditional SQL databases with rigid tables and schemas, MongoDB allows you to store unstructured or semi-structured data easily, making it great for applications like web apps, real-time analytics, or handling varying data formats.
To interact with MongoDB from Python, we use PyMongo, the official Python driver maintained by MongoDB. It's simple, powerful, and the recommended way to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

Step 1: Install PyMongo
First, ensure you have MongoDB running (either locally or on a cloud service like MongoDB Atlas – free tier available).
Install PyMongo using pip:
--------------------------
pip install pymongo
--------------------------

For connections to MongoDB Atlas (which uses SRV), you might need extras:
---------------------------
pip install "pymongo[srv]"
---------------------------
